Boolean Calculator (Infix Notation)

Read a boolean expression (e.g., (A AND (B OR NOT C)))

Implement infix to postfix conversion with logical operator precedence.

Evaluate the postfix expression for different variable values.

Handle multiple negations (e.g., NOT NOT A).

Implement a function to simplify the expression (e.g., double negation elimination, boolean identities).

Optimize memory usage and prevent buffer overflows.
